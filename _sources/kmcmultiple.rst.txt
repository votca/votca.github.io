   * - Property Name
     - Description
     - Default Value
     - Valid Input
   * - runtime
     - | Simulated time in seconds (if a number smaller than 100
       | is given) or number of KMC steps (if a number larger than
       | 100 is given)
     - 1e-4
     - float+
   * - outputtime
     - | Time difference between outputs into the trajectory file.
       | Set to 0 if you wish to have no trajectory written out.
     - 1E-8
     - float+
   * - trajectoryfile
     - Name of the trajectory file
     - trajectory.csv
     - 
   * - ratefile
     - File to write rates
     - rates.dat
     - 
   * - occfile
     - File to write occupation
     - occupation.dat
     - 
   * - seed
     - Integer to initialise the random number generator
     - 123
     - int+
   * - injectionpattern
     - | Name pattern that specifies on which sites injection is
       | possible. Use the wildcard '*' to inject on any site.
     - *
     - 
   * - injectionmethod
     - | random: injection sites are selected randomly (generally
       | the recommended option); equilibrated: sites are chosen
       | such that the expected energy per carrier is matched,
       | possibly speeding up convergence
