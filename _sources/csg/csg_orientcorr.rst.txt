**csg_orientcorr** - Part of the VOTCA package

SYNOPSIS
********
**csg_orientcorr** [OPTIONS]

**csg_orientcorr** [--help]


DESCRIPTION
***********
Calculates the orientational correlation function
    <3/2*u(0)*u(r) - 1/2>
for a polymer melt, where u is the vector pointing along a bond and 
r the distance between bond segments (centered on middle of bond).

OPTIONS
*******
::

  The output is correlation.dat (with intra-molecular contributions) and
  correlation_excl.dat, where inter-molecular contributions are excluded.
  Allowed options:
    -h [ --help ]               display this help and exit
    --verbose                   be loud and noisy
    --verbose1                  be very loud and noisy
    -v [ --verbose2 ]           be extremly loud and noisy
    --top arg                   atomistic topology file
  Neighbor search options:
    -c [ --cutoff ] arg (=1)  cutoff for the neighbor search
    --nbins arg (=40)         number of bins for the grid
    --nbmethod arg (=grid)    neighbor search algorithm (simple or grid)
  Threading options:
    --nt arg (=1)               number of threads
  Trajectory options:
    --trj arg                   atomistic trajectory file
    --begin arg (=0)            skip frames before this time (only works for 
                              Gromacs files)
    --first-frame arg (=0)      start with this frame
    --nframes arg               process the given number of frames
