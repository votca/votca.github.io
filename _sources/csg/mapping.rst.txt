   * - Property Name
     - Description
     - Default Value
   * - ident
     - Molecule name in reference topology.
     - 
   * - topology
     - Section defining coarse grained beads of molecule.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_beads
     - Section defining coarse grained beads of molecule.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_beads.cg_bead
     - Definition of a coarse grained bead.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_beads.cg_bead.name
     - Name of coarse grained bead.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_beads.cg_bead.type
     - Type of coarse grained bead.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_beads.cg_bead.mapping
     - | Mapping scheme to be used for this bead (specified in
       | section mapping) to map from reference system.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_beads.cg_bead.beads
     - | The beads section lists all atoms of the reference system
       | that are mapped to this particular coarse grained bead.
       | The syntax is RESID:RESNAME:ATOMNAME, the beads are separated
       | by spaces.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded
     - | The cg_bonded section contains all bonded interaction
       | of the molecule. Those can be bond, angle or dihedral.
       | An entry for each group of bonded interaction can be specified,
       | e.g. several groups (types) of bonds can be specified.
       | A specific bonded interaction can be later on addressed
       | by MOLECULE:NAME:NUMBER, where MOLECULE is the molecule
       | ID in the whole topology, NAME the name of the interaction
       | group and NUMBER addresses the interaction in the group.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.bond
     - Definition of a group of bonds.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.bond.name
     - Name of the bond.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.bond.beads
     - | List of pair of beads that define a bond. Names specified
       | in cg_beads
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.angle
     - Definition of a group of angles.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.angle.name
     - Name of the angle
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.angle.beads
     - | List of triples of beads that define a bond. Names specified
       | in cg_beads
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.dihedral
     - | Definition of a group of dihedrals. Since the exact functional
       | form does not matter, this combines proper as well as
       | improper dihedrals.
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.dihedral.name
     - Name of the dihedral
     - 
   * - topology.cg_bonded.dihedral.beads
     - | List of quadruples of beads that define a bond. Names
       | specified in cg_beads
     - 
   * - maps
     - Section containing definitions of mapping schemes.
     - 
   * - maps.map
     - Section for a mapping for 1 bead.
     - 
   * - maps.map.name
     - Name of the mapping
     - 
   * - maps.map.weights
     - | Weights of the mapping matrix. Entries are normalized
       | to 1, number of entries must match the number of reference
       | beads in a coarse-grained bead.
