OPTIONS

::

  Allowed options:
    --help                produce this help message
    --in arg              table to read
    --out arg             table to write
    --derivative arg      table to write
    --grid arg            new grid spacing (min:step:max). If 'grid' is specified
                          only, interpolation is performed.
    --type arg (=akima)   [cubic|akima|linear]. If option is not specified, the 
                          default type 'akima' is assumed.
    --fitgrid arg         specify fit grid (min:step:max). If 'grid' and 
                          'fitgrid' are specified, a fit is performed.
    --nocut               Option for fitgrid: Normally, values out of fitgrid 
                          boundaries are cut off. If they shouldn't, choose 
                          --nocut.
    --comment arg         store a comment in the output table
    --boundaries arg      (natural|periodic|derivativezero) sets boundary 
                          conditions
