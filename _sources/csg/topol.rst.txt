   * - Property Name
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - h5md_particle_group
     - 
     - | Attribute name holds the name of particles group in H5MD
       | file
   * - molecules
     - 
     - | The the molecules in the trajectory or other operation
       | on the molecules.
   * - molecules.molecule
     - 
     - | Definition of the molecule, with attributes: name, nmols
       | and nbeads. The name defines residue name, nmols tells
       | how many times this molecule has to be replicated to match
       | with trajectory file and nbeads defines number of beads
       | in every molecule.
   * - molecules.molecule.bead
     - 
     - | Define the bead in the molecule. Attributes are: name
       | - the name of bead, type - the type of bead, mass - the
       | mass of bead, q - the value of charge and resid - the
       | id of the residue the bead belongs to (>=1).
   * - molecules.clear
     - 
     - Clear the information about the molecules
   * - molecules.rename
     - 
     - | Rename the molecules; attributes: "name" - the new name,
       | "range" - the range where the new name will be set in
       | the format start_range:end_range
   * - molecules.define
     - 
     - | Define the molecules; attributes: "name" - the name of
       | molecule, "first" - the id of first molecule, "nbeads"
       | - the number of beads in the molecule, "nmols" - the number
       | of molecules
   * - bonded
     - 
     - | This section defines the topology of the molecules, it
       | is used to generate proper exclusions for calculating
