DESCRIPTION
***********
Calculate spatially confined rdfs

OPTIONS
*******
::

  Allowed options:
    -h [ --help ]             display this help and exit
    --verbose                 be loud and noisy
    --verbose1                be very loud and noisy
    -v [ --verbose2 ]         be extremly loud and noisy
    --top arg                 atomistic topology file
  Mapping options:
    --cg arg                  [OPTIONAL] coarse graining mapping and bond 
                            definitions
                              (xml-file). If no file is given, program acts on 
                            original trajectory
    --map-ignore arg          list of molecules to ignore if mapping is done 
                            separated by ;
  Specific options:
    --options arg             options file defining the rdfs
    --subvolume_radius arg  Rdf calc. in spherical subvolume of this radius (from
                            center of box)
    --do-vol-corr           Correct for subvolume truncation in rdf
    --write-every arg        (UNIMPLEMENTED) write after every block of this 
                            length, if --blocking   is set, the averages are 
                            cleared after every output
    --do-blocks               write output for blocking analysis
  Threading options:
    --nt arg (=1)             number of threads
  Trajectory options:
    --trj arg                 atomistic trajectory file
    --begin arg (=0)          skip frames before this time (only works for 
                            Gromacs files)
    --first-frame arg (=0)    start with this frame
    --nframes arg             process the given number of frames
