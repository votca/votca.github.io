kmclifetime
***********
Perform Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of singlets with decay
The following table contains the defaults input options for the calculator, The default `OPTIONAL` means this option is switched off, if no input is given. 
`REQUIRED` arguments have to be specified, otherwise an error is thrown.
