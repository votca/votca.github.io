Installation
============

## VOTCA structure

VOTCA is currently composed of four major repositories:

* TOOLS - general tools
* CSG - topographical classes and course graining functionality
* XTP - exciton and excited states functionality GW-BSE and DFT engine

TOOLS -> CSG -> XTP

## General (Source) Installation Instructions

To install the full package:

    prefix=WHERE/TO/INSTALL/VOTCA
    version=master # or 'stable' or 'v1.4.1'
    git clone -b ${version} --recursive https://github.com/votca/votca.git
    cd votca
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DBUILD_CSGAPPS=ON -DBUILD_XTP=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${prefix} ..
    make -j5
    make install

### Resolving the 'not found' dependency errors

Assuming all the [dependencies](#dependency-installation) have been correctly
installed, one or more might still appear 'not found' upon configuring with
`cmake` command (see above). In this case you will need to find out the
'non-standard' location for each missed dependency (most often a shared or
dynamically loaded library, e.g. `libgromacs.so.*`, `libhdf5.so.*` etc).

Error messages produced by Cmake usually provide instructive suggestions for
resolving dependency issues. In particular, an appropriate extra `-D` flag is
necessary to specify the path to a missed package. You will have to rerun the
`cmake` command with the relevant flag(s) added. For example, in the case of a
locally installed version of Gromacs:

    cmake -DBUILD_CSGAPPS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${prefix} -DGROMACS_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/gromacs/include -DGROMACS_LIBRARY=$HOME/gromacs/lib/libgromacs.so ..

Be careful to use exactly the option suggested in the error message! You can
also add `-LH` or `-LAH` options to the `cmake` command in order to see the
available options with brief explanations (note that _changing some of the
variables may result in more variables being created_; run `man cmake` for more
info).

_Only for Linux_: For each dependency package not found by Cmake initially, it
might be necessary to add the location of its `lib` directory to the environment
variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, **before** building and installing VOTCA, i.e.
before running any `make` command. For example:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/gromacs/lib:$HOME/anaconda/lib

Note that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` also needs to be set every time when running an
executable from the VOTCA installation afterwards (which can be automated via
user's login profile, e.g. in .bashrc). Alternatively, CMake has options to
_remember_ where libraries came from at link time, which can be enabled by
setting `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH` to `ON`. VOTCA has enabled this
option and a couple of other rpath related tweaks when setting
`ENABLE_RPATH_INJECT` to `ON`.

### Common CMake Flags

* `BUILD_CSGAPPS` - Build the extra csg applications repo (ON/OFF, Default OFF)
* `BUILD_XTP` - Build the xtp repo (ON/OFF, Default OFF)
* `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` - where to install the votca executables (Default is
  /usr/local/bin)
* `ENABLE_TESTING` - compile tests (ON/OFF, Default OFF)

### Other CMake Flags

* `BUILD_CSG_MANUAL` - Build csg pdf manual
* `CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<name>` - Disable using an optional package called
  `<name>` (ON/OFF)
* `CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_HDF5` - Disable using the optional package `HDF5`
  (ON/OFF, Default OFF; relevant only for the `master` branch)

## Legacy (Source) Installation Instructions

Check [dependencies](#dependency-installation) first. Do **NOT** download
anything yourself, this is done by `build.sh` below.

When installing for the first time, run the following commands in bash:

    prefix=WHERE/TO/INSTALL/VOTCA
    mkdir -p ${prefix}/src
    cd ${prefix}/src
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/votca/buildutil/master/build.sh
    chmod +x build.sh
    ./build.sh --prefix ${prefix} --dev tools csg xtp

Replace the _WHERE/TO/INSTALL/VOTCA_ with directory where you want to install
votca, usually \\${HOME}/votca is good choice.

This commands will:

* Create a directory, where the sources are to be stored (above `${prefix}/src`)
* Go there
* Download our build script
* Make the build script executable
* Run the build script to download all votca modules using git, it uses the
  development version, as xtp still undergoes extensive development and no
  releases are available yet.

## Binary Packages for various Linux Distributions

### Fedora

    dnf install votca-csg votca-xtp

### CentOs

    yum install epel-release
    yum update
    yum install votca-csg

### Spack

[Spack](https://spack.io/) is an package manager, which allows to build VOTCA
and all its dependencies:

    git clone clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git spack
    source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
    spack install votca-csg
    spack install votca-xtp

#### Stable version

Spack can also install the latest stable version from git using:

    spack install votca-csg@stable

#### Development version

Spack can also install the latest development version from git using:

    spack install votca-csg@develop

### Docker

Votca is also available through docker and can be accessed and run with the
following docker commands:

    docker pull votca/votca
    docker run -it votca/votca /bin/bash
    
#### Release version

Docker can also install the latest released version, e.g.::

    docker run -it votca/votca:v1.6 /bin/bash

#### Stable version

Docker can also install the latest stable version from git using:

    docker run -it votca/votca:stable /bin/bash

## Linking Error: Undefined reference to
 
This error can happen due to a multitude of reasons. You may have forgotten to add paths to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or forgotten to import an environment module. In these cases deleting the `CMakeCache.txt` in your `build` folder and rerunning `cmake`  will help. Unfortunately another cause might be ABI incompability between libraries due to different libraries being compiled with different compilers or compiler versions. Click [here](https://github.com/ICRAR/shark/issues/1) for an example. 

## GCC and MKL : undefined symbol: 

This can happen with some GCC versions. Adding the `-Wl,--no-as-needed` to `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING=`
to the `CMakeCache.txt` in the `build` directory can fix this. For more information look [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/symbol-lookup-error-when-linking-intel-mkl-with-gcc-on-ubuntu)
